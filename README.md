## What I Learned:

- Css calc() function used and utilized
- The page with numerous beautiful photos was used at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)


## Possible Improvements

- Hover effect can be added to the photos to increase the project detail.
- More code reviews can be added for teamwork
- Formatting could be improved when viewing on certain devices/browsers
- Different design representations can be provided for different resolutions
